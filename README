LOTC SPECIAL ITEMS
dist. 2021/11/29

This is a Minecraft resource pack for special items used on the 
Lord of the Craft (LotC), a medieval-fantasy roleplay server.  
It requires Custom Item Textures (CIT), Custom Entity Models 
(CEM), and Random Entities to work correctly.  All of these mods
are distributed as part of Optifine (optifine.net).

Be aware all larger-than-standard models render too large in the 
inventory GUI.  A suitable solution will be implemented as soon 
as it is discovered.

This pack is created and maintained by PixelatedVolume, who may 
be contacted at pixelatedvolume#7666 on Discord.

Artist credits may be found in a piece's .PROPERTIES file, on the 
line beginning "Art by".
